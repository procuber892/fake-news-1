    <p>I heard that a lot of people are interesed in what the temperatures of countries are since the Weather Network has stoped working, I and the Awesome! people at the Fake news tower staff invented the temperature detector, and here are the reports,
    Since Canada now sits in the Equator with a lot countries they have an average temperature of those countries are 36C to 45C, and the coldest countries are Nigeria at -30C to 10C, and the average temperature of all the remaining countries are 10C to 25C.
