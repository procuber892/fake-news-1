    <h2>How did they end up there?</h2>
    <p>How did the Aliens end up there you ask?, well a week prior to this event, many people gathered up paper to make a big paper, and wrote "you Aliens can never beat us mighty humans". This angered the Alien empire, and triggered an attack on earth, specificley Dubai. This caused all the big and strong countries in military to step in(USA, Russia, China, and India) despite the efforts, they lost, many humans lost their lives, and all lot of them brought back to the planet the aliens lived on</p>
    <h2>What happened to the humans that got caught.</h2>
    <p>"What happens to the humans who got abducted" you ask, even I was wondering about it, every human who tried getting caught to see what happens, never saw earth again. So, people stared sending the AI robots who are really realistic, ha dcameras strapped into there eyes so we know what happens. The answer is shocking, and traumatizing, The humans get eaten by the aliens.</p>
    <h2>Safest places to live in right now.</h2>
    <p>1- Iceland</p>
    <p>2- Greenland</p>
    <p>3- North and South korea(Kim jong un died a long time ago, therefore North korea is safe)</p>
    <p> 4- Hawai and Alaska(there both a bit far from there country)</p>
    <p>5- New zealand(this country is safe in general, because it is far away from other countries and is small, so it is hard to notice by looking at earth)</p>
